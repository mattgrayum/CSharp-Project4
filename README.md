# CSharp-Project4
This is a project from my MIS15 course at California State University Sacramento.
A windows form displays a product list and the user is able to:
  * add items via a dialog form
  * remove items
  * undo a remove item command
  * sort the list of items by any field
  * save valid changes to a simple text file. 
This class is at at the beginning of the series of MIS courses, so we don't get into using databases yet.
